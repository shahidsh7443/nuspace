![setup front page](images/setup-front-page.png)



Setup Menu 
--------------

Although the theme is working now and it shows menu, but because we haven't created a menu for primary location, the theme will display all pages by default. But displaying pages instead of one page sections is a bad idea, because archi is one page theme.

- Go to `Appearance > Menus`
- Select **Primary Menu** or **One Page Menu** or **Sidebar Menu** and click **Select** button to edit it.
- Scroll to bottom of page and check **Primary Menu** for **_Theme location_**

**3**: Select page to create.

------------------------------


Create Your Home Page
====================

archi uses page template and meta box to create home page, so the first step is just creating a page using `Home Page` template (or you can edit exists page that has been imported via sample content file).

![select-page-template](images/page-template.png)

archi theme comes with Visual Composer plugin. This plugin allows you to forget about shortcodes and create most complex layouts within minutes without writing a single line of code!

------------------------------


Post Format
===========

[Post Formats](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats) is theme feature which is a piece of meta information that can be used by a theme to customize its presentation of a post.

In short, with a theme that supports Post Formats, a blogger can change how each post looks by choosing a Post Format from a radio-button list.

archi theme supports the following post formats:

- `gallery` - A gallery of images, which will be displayed in a responsive image slider, powered by Flexslider.
- `image` - A single image, which will be shown above post title.
- `video` - A single video, which can be any video from Youtube, Video or other video websites. Support URL or embed code. The video will be displayed above post title.
- `audio` - An audio file, which can be any video from Youtube, Video or other video websites. Support URL or embed code. The video will be displayed using a powerful HTML5 audio player provided by Wordpress as default player.

Using post format in archi lets you differentiate post from each other and make the blog page / single page looks more beautiful.

[Go to blog page](http://demo.vegatheme.com/archi/blog-right-sidebar/) to see how post formats look.




When you edit a post, select a format you want to apply to that post on the **Format** meta box on the right:

![formats](images/post-format-box.png)

When you choose a format, a corresponding meta box will appear **below** the content editor, here's the list of them:

![formats](images/post-formats.png)

All you need to do is just enter **all** information in the fields in these meta boxes. This information will be used to decorate the post. For example: gallery post format will uses uploaded images to show a slider above post title, a video post will display a video player above post title, etc.


------------------------------


Create And Manage Portfolio
===========================

Setting up the portfolio is quite easy and it requires only a few steps to set it up. Of course you need to install the "OT Portfolio Management" plugin in this case ( if you have not done it already ). Within the first step we recommend to create the portfolio categories first. This will make sure everything is right there when you need it. But what are portfolio categories? Let's take a look at the following example. Imagine you are a photographer and you have a wide range of images you like to show to the crowd. Inside your portfolio you have landscape and portrait images, than these both would be exactly your categories. Categories are mainly used for filtering your portfolio items later on.


Add New Portfolio Categories
------------------------


![Portfolio category](images/portfolio-category.png)

In order to add new Portfolio category:


**[1]** Go to `Portfolio > Categories`

**[2]** Enter category name and hit `Enter`


Add New Portfolio Project
---------------------

**[1]** Setup Visual Composer for create new portfolio

In WordPress Admin Panel -> WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) -> Role Manage -> Post Types and select "Custom" -> Chooise post type "portfolio" -> Save Change

![Set Visual Composer for create portfolio](images/set_visual_composer_portfolio.png)

**[2]** Now you can start adding your portfolio item. Go to `Portfolio > Add new`. Basically there is not big difference to a regular blog post, all elements like featured image and the WordPress Editor are in the same place.

![Portfolio Add New](images/portfolio-add-new.png)

And these portfolio posts are handeled exactly the same way as blog post, with one exception, you need to set a featured image for all kind of post formats. These images are used inside the portfolio overview.

**[2.1]** Enter portfolio project name here

**[2.2]** Select `backend editor` to add element 

**[2.3]** Add element

![portfolio element](images/portfolio-element.png)

**[2.4]** Add categories

**[2.5]** Upload portfolio featured image

**[2.6]** Click `publish`


--------------------------


Create And Manage Process
===========================


Add New Process
------------

Now you can start adding your process. Go to Process > Add Process. Basically there is not big difference to a regular blog post, all elements like featured image and the WordPress Editor are in the same place.

![Process Add New](images/add-new-process.png)


**[1]** Enter process name here.

**[2]** Enter a description about your process.

**[3]** Add custom fields.

**[4]** Click `publish`


-----------------------------


Create And Manage Service
===========================


Add New Service
------------

Now you can start adding your Service. Go to Service > Add Service. Basically there is not big difference to a regular blog post, all elements like featured image and the WordPress Editor are in the same place.

![Service Add New](images/add-new-service.png)


**[1]** Enter service name here.

**[2]** Add content about your service.

**[3]** Add custom fields.

**[4]** Upload service featured image.

**[5]** Click `publish`


----------------------------


Translation
=========

###Tell WordPress which language file to use.

If you don’t use WordPress in your native language so far, you have to tell WordPress which language to use to activate the theme translation.

You can do this by editing the wp-config.php file (the file is located in the main directory of your WordPress files) and defining the WPLANG constant. You have to set your language code there, for example fr_FR for French translation.

ust add the line below to your wp-config.php or change it if it already exists:

`define ('WPLANG', 'fr_FR');`


###First Method: Using Codestyling Plugin

The easiest way to translate your theme locally is by using the [Codestyling Localization](https://wordpress.org/plugins/codestyling-localization/) plugin. After you have installed and activated the plugin, simply go to `Tools > Localization` (shown in your language) and translate the theme from your WordPress backend following the [plugin instructions](http://www.code-styling.de/english/development/wordpress-plugin-codestyling-localization-en)

###Second Mothod: Using Poedit

Poedit is a common program which you can use to translate the theme. It’s available for free on [poedit.net](http://www.poedit.net/).

After you have installed Poedit, you can open it and select `File > New Catalog from POT file`. Then select the .pot file from the theme you wish to translate which you can find in the `/languages/` folder of theme.

Then go through every line of text and translate it to your native language. Afterwards you can save the catalog with your language code (for example `en_US.po`). Normally Poedit automatically creates the .mo file and saves it, too.

The last step you have to do is to upload your created language files to the language folder of your theme using FTP.


------------------------------


Child Theme
===========

Fastlat is fully child theme compatible. We have attached a basic child theme to the download package which contains the minimum of required files. If you are planing any code customisations we highly recommend to do this inside the child theme! Learn more about child themes [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)
